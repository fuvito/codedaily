# CodeDaily — Daily JavaScript & Python Coding Challenges

CodeDaily is a small, focused practice lab for building a **daily coding habit**.
The goal is to provide short, finishable challenges that fit into a busy day, with
clear structure across 7‑day and 28‑day tracks so you always know what to do next.

## Challenge Tracks

- **7 Days JavaScript (Basics):** Variables, control flow, functions, and core JS.
- **28 Days JavaScript (Basic → Advanced):** From fundamentals to modern JS and TS.
- **7 Days Python (Basics):** Console‑based Python scripts focusing on fundamentals.
- **28 Days Python (Fundamentals → Real World):** From basics to OOP, data, and APIs.

Each track includes:

- Focused daily challenge prompts
- Short background/context
- Starter code snippets
- A notes area so learners can record insights

## Technologies

- **Framework:** Angular (standalone components, router)
- **Language:** TypeScript for the frontend, JavaScript/Python for challenge code
- **Styling:** Custom CSS plus Bootstrap utilities
- **Build tooling:** Angular CLI

## Development

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.2.

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

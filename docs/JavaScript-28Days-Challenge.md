Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: DOM manipulation logic.

### Day 14 – Modules

Challenge: Split your code into modules: utils, numbers, strings, etc.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Logic organization and import/export.

## WEEK 3 — TypeScript + Advanced JavaScript

Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Union types, narrowing, pattern matching.

### Day 17 – Generics

Challenge: Build a reusable wrapInArray<T>(item: T) generic utility.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Generic functions and constraints.

### Day 18 – Classes & OOP

Challenge: Build a User, Admin, and Guest class with inheritance.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: OOP fundamentals in TS.

### Day 19 – Promises

Challenge: Create a fake API call using setTimeout and return a Promise with resolve/reject.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Promise chain, .then/.catch.

### Day 20 – Async/Await

Challenge: Rewrite the previous challenge using async/await + error handling.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Asynchronous refinement.

### Day 21 – Fetch API + Data Handling

Challenge: Use fetch to call a mock API, validate the response, and transform the data.
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Data fetching, async workflows.

## WEEK 4 — Expert Level JavaScript / TS Challenges
Goal: Advanced logic, performance, architecture & real-world patterns

### Day 22 – Closures

Challenge: Implement a counter function that supports .increment() and .reset().
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Understand closures and scope.

### Day 23 – Recursion

Challenge: Build a recursive function to flatten a deeply nested array.
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Recursive problem-solving.

### Day 24 – Functional Programming

Challenge: Create a pure function pipeline that composes 3 functions into one.
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Function composition, immutability.

### Day 25 – Advanced TypeScript: Utility Types

Challenge: Rebuild a Partial<T> or Pick<T> utility manually.
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Deep TS understanding.

### Day 26 – Data Structures

Challenge: Implement your own Stack or Queue class in TypeScript.
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Low-level memory & DS fundamentals.

### Day 27 – Algorithms

Challenge: Build a function to detect duplicates in an array with O(n) time.
Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Algorithmic efficiency.

### Day 28 – Architecture + Final Challenge

Challenge:
Build a small mini-project combining EVERYTHING learned:

fetch API

async/await

types

classes

array methods

error handling

modules

A sample final project:
“GitHub User Explorer”
→ Input username → fetch repos → sort by stars → display summary object.

Difficulty: Hard
Outcome: Full-stack mental model & confidence.

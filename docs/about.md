## Purpose

CodeDaily is a small, focused practice lab for building a **daily coding habit**.
The goal is to provide short, finishable challenges that fit into a busy day, with
clear structure across 7‑day and 28‑day tracks so you always know what to do next.

## Technologies

- **Framework:** Angular (standalone components, router)
- **Language:** TypeScript for the frontend, JavaScript/Python for challenge code
- **Styling:** Custom CSS plus Bootstrap utilities
- **Build tooling:** Angular CLI

## Challenge Tracks

- **7 Days JavaScript (Basics):** Variables, control flow, functions, and core JS.
- **28 Days JavaScript (Basic → Advanced):** From fundamentals to modern JS and TS.
- **7 Days Python (Basics):** Console‑based Python scripts focusing on fundamentals.
- **28 Days Python (Fundamentals → Real World):** From basics to OOP, data, and APIs.

Each track includes:

- Focused daily challenge prompts
- Short background/context
- Starter code snippets
- A notes area so learners can record insights

## Design Principles

- **Daily momentum:** One clear task per day instead of long, unfocused courses.
- **Consistency:** Shared layouts and styles across JS/Python and 7/28‑day tracks.
- **Clarity:** Plain‑language descriptions, explicit concepts, and visible progress.

## Roadmap

- Add more subjects (frontend frameworks, backend fundamentals, data tooling)
- Integrate a Supabase‑backed backend for saving progress
- Introduce richer progress views and optional scoring/achievements
